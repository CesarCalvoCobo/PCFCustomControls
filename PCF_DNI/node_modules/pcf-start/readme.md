### Overview

This package contains the infrastructure required to internally test and debug a custom PCF (PowerApps Component Framework) control for Microsoft PowerApps. The scripts are designed to be used in conjunction with the Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool, which is separately available via an MSI installer. 

A link to publicly available documentation for the Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool will be added here once the tool is publicly available.

**Without Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool this package should only be used for reference purposes.**
